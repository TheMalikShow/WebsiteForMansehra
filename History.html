Ashoka governed this area as a prince, imperial throne c. 272 BCE. he made it one of the major seats of his government. The Edicts of Ashoka inscribed on three large boulders near Mansehra record fourteen of Ashoka's edicts, presenting aspects of the emperor's dharma or righteous law. These represent some of the earliest evidence of deciphered writing in South Asia, dating to middle of the third century BCE, and are written from right to left in the Kharosthi script.

    <b>Shungas, Kushans, and Guptas</b>
    <br>
    The region was briefly and nominally controlled by the Shunga Empire. However, with the decline of the Shungas, the region passed to local Hindu and Buddhist rulers, and interrupted by foreign rulers. Many of these foreign rulers, like the Indo-Parthians, Sakas, and Kushans converted to Buddhism, and promoted these Indian religions throughout Central and South Asia. The region reached its height under the Buddhist ruler Kanishka the Great. After the fall of the Kushans, the region came under the control of the Gupta Empire of ancient India. During the period, Hindu and Buddhist art and architecture flourished in the area.

    <b>Hindu Shahi rule</b>
    <br>
    With the decline of the imperial Guptas, the Hindu Shahis came to rule the area. The Hindu Shahis built two massive forts in the northern edges of the region. The forts were later renamed as "Kafirkots" (forts of the infidel). These Hindu Shahi forts were known for high towers and steep defensive walls. The Hindus also built many Hindu temples around the area, however, much of them are now in rubble. The Hindu Shahis remained in control of the area until their defeat by the Turkic Muslim army of Ghaznavids.

    <b>Durranis and Marathas</b>
    <br>
    Ahmad Shah Durrani, the founder of the Afghan Durrani Empire, captured the region around the mid-1700s, however, Durrani quickly retreated from the region. Ahmad Shah Durrani again invaded the region with Timur Shah Durrani having nominal rule. Durrani rule was interrupted by the Maratha Empire's under Raghunathrao, who drove out the Afghans, Following the Third Battle of Panipat, Ahmad Shah Durrani defeated the Marathas and recaptured Lahore, Sikh forces occupied the region after the Durranis withdrew. The Durranis invaded two more times, while the Sikhs would re-occupy the region after both invasions.

    <b>Sikh rule</b>
    <br>
    The fall of the Afghan Durrani Empire made way for the Sikhs to rise to power under Ranjit Singh. The Sikhs gained control of the area in 1818. The town of Mansehra was founded by Mahan Singh Mirpuri, a Sikh governor. There were popular uprisings against Sikh rule, but these uprisings failed and the Sikhs remained in power until 1849 when the area came under British rule.The town is named in Mahan Singh Mirpuri's honor.

    <b>British period</b>
    <br>
    By 1849, the British had gained control of all of Mansehra. To maintain peace in the area, the British took preventive measures by co-opting the local chiefs.

    The British divided Hazara region into three tehsils (administrative subdivisions): Mansehra, Abbottabad, and Haripur. In 1901, when the British formed the buffer province of North West Frontier Province (NWFP), Hazara was annexed into it.

    During British rule, Mansehra was a small town. Its population according to the 1901 census was 5,087. During the British period, Mansehra was the headquarters of Mansehra Tehsil.

    In 1976 Mansehra Tehsil was made district and Mansehra became the centre of it.</p>
